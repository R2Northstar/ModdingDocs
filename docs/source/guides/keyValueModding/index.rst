Weapon and key value modding
===========================


Weapon Modding
--------------

Do keep in mind that these are usually changed server-side.

To actually change the keyvalues of weapons you'd have to name them appropriately inside a mod folder
For example: ``R2Northstar\mods\Northstar.Custom\keyvalues\scripts\weapons``
You can find all the weapon keyvalues `here <https://github.com/BigSpice/TitanFall_2_Weapon_Skin_Modding/tree/main/Weapon_Scripts>`_

Example for modding crossshairs using keyvalues: :doc:`crosshairmodding`

- Mod Examples:

  - `Northstar.Custom <https://github.com/R2Northstar/NorthstarMods/tree/main/Northstar.Custom>`_
  - `Unholy Trinity <https://github.com/xamionex/xamionex.UnholyTrinity>`_
  - `Kraber9K <https://github.com/Steveplays28/kraber9k>`_
