Contributing to ModdingDocs
===========================

**How can I contribute?**

All contributions to ModdingDocs are welcome. 

Including:

- Issues with your knowledge or info dumps.
- Pull Requests with you contributed content
  
**What do I need to know to contribute?**

ModdingDocs uses `reStructuredText <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText>`_.

Cheatsheet for reStructuredText syntax: https://docs.generic-mapping-tools.org/6.2/rst-cheatsheet.html.

The ``.rst`` files can be found in the ``docs/source`` directory. If you're adding a new file, make sure to link it in ``index.rst``

Contributing without a local build
----------------------------------
You don't necessarily need to set up a local build environment.

To contribute without doing so, you can just edit the files in an editor of your choice and create a GitHub pull request from them.

There will be a test-build done for each PR, which you can find on your PR as a "Check" by clicking ``show all checks`` and ``details``.

This should take you to a online version of the docs with your PRs changes. 


Building locally
----------------

You need to have a relatively recent version of Python installed - 3.8 or higher. `Download here <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_

.. tab-set::

    .. tab-item:: Windows

        .. code-block:: powershell

            git clone https://github.com/R2Northstar/ModdingDocs/
            cd ModdingDocs
            ./run.ps1
    
    .. tab-item:: Linux

        .. code-block:: bash

            git clone https://github.com/R2Northstar/ModdingDocs/
            cd ModdingDocs
            ./run.sh

.. warning::
    On Windows, if you are not able to run the script by running `./run.ps1`, try running it with: `powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\run.ps1`

    After this you should be able to run with just `./run.ps1`.


VSCode
---------------

If you're using `Visual Studio Code <https://code.visualstudio.com/>`_, the following extensions might be of interest:


- `snekvik.simple-rst <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=trond-snekvik.simple-rst>`_: for syntax highlighting
- `lextudio.restructuredtext <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=lextudio.restructuredtext>`_: for autocompletion and syntax checks.

.. note::
    To get the ReStructuredText support working, you will likely need to tell VSCode to use the Poetry environment.

    To do so, open one of the .py files, which should make the python version appear in the bottom right of VSCode.

    Click on it, and select the version with ``(moddingdocs`` after it.

    Then, when looking at a ReStructuredText file there should be ``esbonio:`` in the bottom right.

    Click that to restart the ReStructuredText support. This allows it to see all the dependencies Poetry installed.
