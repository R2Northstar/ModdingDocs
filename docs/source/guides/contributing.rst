Setting up the build environment for docs
-----------------------------------------

You don't necessarily need to do this. You could just edit the files in an editor of your choice and then push the changes, wait for a GitHub actions to create a build and then check it out online. However, building the documentation locally allows you to quickly see whether the changes you made were correct or if there were any issues.

To set up a build locally, do the following:

Clone the `ModdingDocs repo <https://github.com/R2Northstar/ModdingDocs/>`_, e.g.


.. code:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/R2Northstar/ModdingDocs/


Opened the clone repo.

Setup a `Python virtual environment <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html>`_
(this is not strictly necessary but can help keep your Python install clean)

.. code:: bash

    # Create virtual environment
    python3 -m venv venv

    # On Windows, activate with:
    venv\Scripts\activate.bat

    # On Linux, activate with:
    source venv/bin/activate

Install the Python packages necessary to build the docs

.. code:: bash

    pip install -r docs/requirements.txt

Finally to actually build the docs, go to the ``docs/`` directory and ``sphinx-build -M html source build``, i.e.

.. code:: bash

    cd docs/
    sphinx-build -M html source build

This will create a new folder inside ``docs/`` called ``build/`` where under ``html/`` you can find the rendered HTML files where built based from the ``.rst`` files located in ``source``. You can open the files in a browser of your choice to see what the edited page will look like.
