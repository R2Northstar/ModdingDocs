Map Files
^^^^^^^^^

Examples:
=========

1. Bare Minimum - No Assets
---------------------------

``example1.json``

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "version": 7
    }

.. code-block::

    root
    ├── RePak.exe
    ├── example1.json
    └── build
        └─ example1.rpak

.. note ::
    This example map file is honestly pretty useless. It has no assets, because there is no ``files`` field.

    It also will have the name ``new.rpak`` and will be created in the ``./build`` folder.

2. Single Texture
-------------------

``example2.json``

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "name": "example2",
        "assetsDir": "../depot",
        "outputDir": "../output",
        "version": 7,
        "files":
        [
            {
                "$type": "txtr"
                "path": "textures/models/my_texture"
            }
        ]
    }

.. code-block::

    root
    ├── RePak.exe
    ├── maps
    |   └─ example2.json
    ├── depot
    |   └─ textures
    |       └─ models
    |           └─ my_texture.dds
    └── output
        └─ example2.rpak

.. note ::
    This example map file creates an RPak named ``example2.rpak`` which contains 1 texture asset.

.. note ::
    The texture will replace any vanilla textures that have the same path. ( ``textures/models/my_texture`` )
    
    This is useful for creating basic skins and camos.

Structure:
==========

name
----

The ``name`` field of a map file determines the name of the resulting RPak.

The ``name`` is appended with ``.rpak`` and defaults to ``new`` if no ``name`` is provided. 
This results in a default RPak called ``new.rpak``.

.. warning ::
    In the event that no ``name`` is provided in the map file, RePak will output the following warning to the console:

    ``Map file should have a 'name' field containing the string name for the new rpak, but none was provided. Defaulting to 'new.rpak' and continuing...\n``

assetsDir
---------

The ``assetsDir`` field of a map file determines the root path which the program combines with the ``path`` for assets in order to find the correct file.
This path may be a relative path, or an absolute path.

The ``assetsDir`` provided in the map file is appended with a slash ( ``\`` ) if necessary

.. warning ::
    If no ``assetsDir`` is provided, it defaults to the working directory ( ``.\`` ) as well as outputting the following warning to the console:

    ``No assetsDir field provided. Assuming that everything is relative to the working directory.\n``

outputDir
---------

The ``outputDir`` field of a map file determines the folder that the program will write the RPak and StaRPak files to once they have been created.
This path may be a relative path, or an absolute path.

The ``outputDir`` provided in the map file is appended with a slash ( ``\`` ) if necessary

If no ``outputDir`` is provided in the map file, RePak defaults to ``.\build\``

version
-------

The ``version`` field of a map file determines the RPak version that RePak will create.

.. error ::
    If no ``version`` field is provided, RePak will output the following error and the program will stop:

    ``Map file doesn't specify an RPak version\nUse 'version: 7' for Titanfall 2 or 'version: 8' for Apex\n``

.. error ::
    If an invalid ``version`` field is provided, RePak will output the following error and the program will stop:

    ``Invalid RPak version specified\nUse 'version: 7' for Titanfall 2 or 'version: 8' for Apex\n``

List of known ``version`` values:
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

* ``6``: Titanfall 2: Tech Test **[UNSUPPORTED]**
* ``7``: Titanfall 2
* ``8``: Apex Legends

files
-----

The ``files`` field of a map file is an array of JSON objects, each one representing an RPak asset.

RePak will not throw any errors if no ``files`` field is specified, however the resulting RPak will contain no assets, rendering it useless.
