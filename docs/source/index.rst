Welcome to the Northstar Modding Documentation!
===============================================



.. note::

   This project is under active development. Please PR everything you can!

Contents
--------

These docs contain info on squirrel usage and northstar/respawn functions. Its very much WIP.

For now we are focusing on moving over things that were documented in other places (discord, pastebin, gists etc.).

If you know anything about any function, object or concept please dont hesitate to contribute it, even if its just a quick and dirty PR.
